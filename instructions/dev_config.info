//Configure local .env file from copy of .env.default

/* to get css working */
//create the dist folder inside the main working directory ( if  you don't already have one )
//then from /tools folder run:
node uglify.js
//exit process or leave open to automatically reuglify whenever you change .css files

/* header image */
//if you want a header image, put a file in dist called "the_zebra_head.jpg"

/* to get data for testing */
 //load data into mongo, from / folder:
 node injector.js - gives you options of what to inject, do them in any order, they wipe out old data entirely

//start local server, or point .env to active installation
node index.js

/* to register your computer to be allowed to use this app instance */
//from /tools folder run:
 node getRegistrationCode.js list,
 then node getRegistrationCode.js {number of the device name you want to register under from previous step output}
 then run node index.js and visit url from previous step output - select correct device name and voila!
//if it doesn't work - make sure your index.js file is running ( see previous section above )

/* play around */
 //then node index.js and poke around. running injector.js again will clear all data and reinstall
