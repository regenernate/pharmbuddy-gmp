This is the process to follow when a device registration is lost.

Log in to one of the admin devices and follow the steps below. If you don't know what the preceding sentence means,
thats a good sign that you should contact Nathan, or if Nathan is unavailable, try Ben.

First, open a terminal window using spotlight, as shown below:

1) press cmd and spacebar at the same time
2) begin typing t e r m until "terminal" appears in the search results
3) press enter

* this should open a terminal window ( a somewhat amorphous looking black window )

Next, navigate to the utility for generating registration codes, as follows:

1) in the new terminal window type or copy and paste:

cd ~/Desktop/ravenridge/dev/pharmbuddy-gmp/tools

2) press enter

Now run the utility to get the device number you are trying to register:

1) in the terminal window type or copy and paste:

node getRegistrationCodes.js list

2) press enter

From the resulting list printed in the terminal window, note the number for the device you want to register.
If you already know your device number, you can skip this step in the future ...

Finally, run the utility to generate the code for the device number you found in the previous step.

1) in the terminal window type the following, substituting the proper device number for {device_number}:

node getRegistrationCodes.js {device_number} prod

2) press enter

as an example, typing

node getRegistrationCodes.js 1 prod

will return a registration code for the Basement 27" imac

CONGRATULATIONS, you have generated a new registration code. Use it carefully because
it only guarantees a single attempt to register.

TO REGISTER WITH YOUR REGISTRATION CODE

Copy the url that resulted from the previous steps and paste it into your browser's location bar.
( If you want to use your device with multiple browsers, you will have to create separate registration codes. )

1) Select the url outputted from the previous steps with your mouse
2) press cmd + c to copy it
3) go back to chrome or whatever browser you intend to use
4) select everything in the location bar with your mouse
5) press cmd + p to paste the copied url into the location bar
6) press enter

If all went properly, you should see a screen where you can select
the device name that matches the registration code you are using.
